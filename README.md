# AI801-Chess-Group-project
To run the beta version of the chess board install from requirements by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You can either do this with or without the use of a virtual environment.

To create or use a virtual environment run the command

python -m venv ./venv

Then navigate to the Scripts folder that has appeared in ./venv and run the activate.bat.
From there you should have a local python version solely for this project.

This is just a rough draft of the board with no fancy features, but you can pseudo-play yourself with it.

Happy coding team and remember to run "git checkout -b <branch-name>" so we aren't working in main.
